## Main Changes
Reverted the game to a BOBW design where the game now runs on v1.5.97 (aka, SE) while retaining CC content. This is a temporary measure as I'd like to be on the latest version but it is too unstable right now to do so

ANVIL has been utilised now as the baseline LBOE has been built on. The weather, CS and other important visual elements from LBOE have remained however

General reduction of mods in areas, particularly settlement expansion due to terrain issues and fps issues
