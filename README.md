## Introduction
Welcome to LBOE, the Skyrim Anniversary Edition modlist where you simply seek to have a little bit of everything. This is a modlist that does not aim to provide the strongest visuals, the slickest gameplay or the most amount of additional content. Instead it aims to provide a more reasonable expansion to these three elements to provide something more enjoyable while still being good old Skyrim

## What to expect
**Visuals**
- Project Clarity providing a baseline improvement
- Skyland AIO and Cathedral Landscapes dealing with most environmental improvements alongside smaller accompanying mods
- Postprocessing improvements from the Community Shaders
- Cathedral Armory dealing with most armour and weapon improvements alongside smaller accompanying mods
- Tempered Skins series dealign with NPC and Player appearances alongside smaller accompanying mods

**Gameplay**
- Parts of SimonMagnus's gameplay overhaul series is used. The entire suite is not used
- General gameplay uplifts from Precision, True Directional Movement, etc.

**New Content**
- New quest mods including Helgen Reborn, Konahrik's Accoutrements, Moon and Star and The Forgotten City
- New DLC sized mod in the form of Wyrmstooth
- New followers, quests and NPCs from Interesting NPCs


# What not to expect
**Visuals**
- Any major NPC appearance overhauls
- ENB
- Texture quality on average above Skyrim's original quality

**Gameplay**
- New major systems such as faiths and classes

**New Content**
- Legacy of the Dragonborn
- Revoiced NPCs
- Vastly expanded questlines


## System Requirements
Generally speaking this list should not be highly intensive on your pc. That being said the visual quality has been improved so you will need a computer that can run Skyrim above vanilla
As for my own system specifications they are as follows:
- CPU               - AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4GHz
- Motherboard       - ASRock b450 Pro4
- RAM               - Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 3200Hz
- Storage (Main)    - Crucial P3 1TB SSD
- Storage (Backup)  - Seagate Barracude 1TB 7200RPM HDD
- GPU               - Sapphire NITRO RX580 8GB VRAM
- PSU               - EVGA Bronze 80+ 500W

On my pc an average of 60fps at 1080p is expected with some occasional dips
