## Introduction
Welcome to LBOE, the Skyrim Anniversary Edition modlist where you simply seek to have a little bit of everything. 

This is a modlist that does not aim to provide the strongest visuals, the slickest gameplay or the most amount of additional content. 

Instead it aims to provide a more reasonable expansion to these three elements to provide something more enjoyable while still being good old Skyrim

## What to expect
**Visuals**
- Project Clarity providing a baseline improvement
- Skyland AIO dealing with most environmental improvements alongside smaller accompanying mods
- RAID Weathers and Ambiance dealing with all matters weather and lighting
- Nordic Faces and other selected mods improving the general appearance of NPCs and the Player
- Postprocessing improvements from the Community Shaders

**Gameplay**
- Parts of SimonMagnus's gameplay overhaul series is used. The entire suite is not used
- General gameplay uplifts from Precision, True Directional Movement, etc.

**New Content**
- New quest mods including Helgen Reborn, Konahrik's Accoutrements, Moon and Star and The Forgotten City
- New DLC sized mod in the form of Wyrmstooth
- New followers, quests and NPCs from Interesting NPCs


# What not to expect
**Visuals**
- Any major NPC appearance overhauls
- ENB
- Texture quality on average above Skyrim's original quality

**Gameplay**
- New major systems such as faiths and classes
- Anything that would make the game more "hardcore"

**New Content**
- Legacy of the Dragonborn
- Revoiced NPCs
- Vastly expanded questlines


## System Requirements
Generally speaking this list should not be highly intensive on your pc. That being said the visual quality has been improved so you will need a computer that can run Skyrim above vanilla

As for my own system specifications they are as follows:
- CPU               - AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4GHz
- Motherboard       - ASRock b450 Pro4
- RAM               - Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 3200Hz
- Storage (Main)    - Crucial P3 1TB SSD
- Storage (Backup)  - Seagate Barracude 1TB 7200RPM HDD
- GPU               - Sapphire NITRO RX580 8GB VRAM
- PSU               - EVGA Bronze 80+ 500W

On my pc an average of 60fps at 1080p is expected with some occasional dips


## FAQ
### Sources of Inspiration?
Skyrim Modding Essentials by ForeverPhoenix formed the baseline of the list. I thoroughly recommend it if you are looking to create your own Skyrim mod setup

Septimus by GuitarNinja was a major design influence and this modlist is made in its spirit

Various selections from Lexy's LOTD 

### Why isn't (Insert mod here) included?
Usually I do not include a mod for the following reasons:
- It goes beyond the intention of the list
- It possesses technical and/or compatibility issues
- It is simply something I'm not personally interested in

I am open to suggestions but if you do wish to make one then keep in mind the above criteria

### Can I add/remove mods?
You're welcome to do so and can also use this list as a baseline to build off of if you wish. Keep in mind however that you will need to be responsible for things like Conflict Resolution as my help will be limited

### Widescreen Support?
I don't personally own a widescreen monitor so I am unable to test and properly support widescreen. Community support may help in this matter however

### GOG Support?
I don't own Skyrim on GOG so I am unable to test and properly support it

# Installation
## Pre-Installation
**Base Requirements**
- Skyrim Anniversary Edition + DLC Upgrade on Steam (Clean reinstall required)
- Creation Kit on Steam
- Latest version of windows 10
- A nexus mods account (Premium is recommended by Wabbajack to automate installation but you can use a free one)
- Latest NVIDIA/AMD Drivers
- 125GB of storage space available in total (75GB of installed mods and about 50GB of downloads)

**MO2 Requirements**
- [Latest Microsoft Visual C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
- [Latest .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)

**Setting up Skyrim**
- Confirm first that you are on the latest version of Skyrim (version 1.6.640.0). You can check by going to SkyrimSE.exe, right-clicking and selecting **Details**
- Launch Skyrim at least once. This is to allow it to generate important ini files as well as make sure you've downloaded all CC

**Set the game language to English**
This is a temporary measure as Wabbajack requires the english version of the game to work correctly. You can revert the language back after installation

**Setting up Creation Kit**
- When installing Creation Kit ensure it is installed inside Skyrim Special Edition's directory (Same folder as its .exe file)
- Run Creation Kit at least once. On starting up it'll ask you to extract scripts, click yes and wait for that to finish
- Once Creation Kit has finished loading, exit.

## Wabbajack Installation
## Installing Wabbajack
Download [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
- Extract the file and place it in an easy to access location. DO NOT however place it inside any UAC controlled folders e.g. Program Files, Program Files (x86), Downloads, Documents, etc.
- For reference my wabbajack location is C:\Games\Modding\Wabbajack
- Double click wabbajack.exe and let the program update itself if needed

## Downloading and Installing LBOE
Click "Browse Modlists" in Wabbajacks menu
find "Little Bit Of Everything (LBOE)" in the gallery and click on the arrow button to download the installation file
In the installation window, you will be asked to define the locations of two folders:
- Installation Location which is where LBOE will be installed. Choose an easy to access folder such as C:\Aurora\ that is outside UAC protected folders (Program Files, Documents, etc).

Download Location is where the downloaded mod archives will be stored. By default, they will be placed within your main Aurora folder, but you can change the file path if you want to keep the files elsewhere.

Once both folder locations have been set, click the button on the right to begin the installation process.
